## Understanding @ConfigurationProperties Annotation in SpringBoot

### Introduction
In Spring Boot, configuration management is essential to handle externalized properties such as environment settings, database connections, and custom application properties. 
One powerful and convenient tool for doing this is the @ConfigurationProperties annotation, which allows developers to map external configurations directly to Java objects. This article delves into the purpose, usage, and benefits of using @ConfigurationProperties for managing application settings.

### What is @ConfigurationProperties?
The @ConfigurationProperties annotation in Spring Boot is used to bind external configuration properties (defined in application.properties or application.yml) to a Plain Old Java Object (POJO). This makes it easier to handle application-specific settings in a clean and organized way. By grouping related configurations together under a specific prefix, we can avoid scattering properties all over the codebase.
Key Features:
Allows you to map configuration values directly to fields in a Java object.
Supports nested properties and hierarchical data structures.
Ensures type safety, providing strong validation of properties at startup.

### Why Use @ConfigurationProperties?
Using @ConfigurationProperties provides several advantages:
Separation of concerns: Application configurations are decoupled from the business logic, promoting cleaner code.
Type safety: Unlike reading configuration values directly from Environment or @Value, @ConfigurationProperties ensures that properties are bound to types correctly.
Structured and organized configurations: It allows for grouping related configurations together under a specific prefix, making the properties easier to manage and understand.

### How @ConfigurationProperties Works
At its core, @ConfigurationProperties maps property values defined in the configuration file (like application.yml or application.properties) to fields in a Java class. The key aspect is that you specify a prefix for properties to be bound.
Example: Mapping Properties to a POJO

Let's walk through an example where we use @ConfigurationProperties to load application-specific settings.

##### Step 1: Define Configuration Properties in application.properites file. 
In this example, we configure the name, description, and version of an application. These are the properties we want to map.

application.properties
```
spring.application.name=ConfigMaster

app.name=ConfigApp
app.description=A site for config management
app.version=1.0
```

##### Step 2: Create a POJO to Bind the Properties

```
package com.configmaster.config;

import lombok.Data;
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
@Data
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "app")
public class AppProperties {
    private String name;
    private String description;
    private String version;
}
```
In this class, the @ConfigurationProperties annotation indicates that the properties with the prefix "app" should be bound to the fields of AppProperties.

##### Step 3: Injecting the Configuration in Your Application
Now, you can inject the AppProperties class wherever it's needed. For instance, in a controller or service class, you can access the configuration values:

```
package com.configmaster.api;

import com.configmaster.config.AppProperties;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/config")
public class ConfigTestApiEndPoint {
private final AppProperties appProperties;

    @Autowired
    public ConfigTestApiEndPoint(AppProperties appProperties) {
        this.appProperties = appProperties;
    }

    @GetMapping("/info")
    public String getAppInfo() {
        return "App Name: " + appProperties.getName() +
                ", Description: " + appProperties.getDescription() +
                ", Version: " + appProperties.getVersion();
    }
}
```

The ConfigTestApiEndPoint class accesses the properties defined in AppProperties and can return them as part of a REST endpoint.

### Conclusion
The @ConfigurationProperties annotation in Spring Boot offers a powerful and flexible way to manage external configuration properties. It promotes better separation of concerns by decoupling configuration from business logic, ensures type safety, and allows for easy validation of property values. By leveraging this annotation, you can keep your code clean, maintainable, and scalable, making it a crucial part of modern Spring Boot applications.
For any project that requires organized management of configuration data, @ConfigurationProperties is a must-use tool!
